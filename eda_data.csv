Position Description
These are exciting times for CGI.

Our successful Delivery Centre is continuing to expand and we're looking for more talented individuals in Belfast to help us meet growing demand from our clients. We have clients across multiple industries in both the private and public sectors and our work varies from rapid prototyping to multi-year digital transformation projects.

What are we looking for from you? You will be someone who already makes a difference, and we will give you the freedom and responsibility to continue doing so. You’ll be using a range of modern approaches and frameworks to deliver and you’ll be able to take ownership of your work. You will become part of a fast-growing, pioneering working environment as we continue to grow our business over the coming months and years.

We're offering the best of both worlds – an agile-by-default, technology-focused working environment combined with the opportunities and benefits of being part of a large organisation.

All successful applicants must hold, or be eligible & willing to obtain, UK Security Clearance (SC) with the view to progressing to higher level clearance if required.



Your future duties and responsibilities
You will be technically minded and be able to understand the technical constraints and complexities of delivering modern software – it is critical that you have a problem solving mentality and also be able to think outside the box.
You will be able to converse with and understand all areas and skills within cross-functional teams and be able to add to the technical solution or design of a particular project where there is value to be unlocked.
You will have excellent communication and stakeholder management skills, with the ability to also work with business stakeholders both internally and externally. As part of your role you may be also involved in Bid and Pre-Sales activities as part of CGI’s business generation initiatives where experience of scoping and high level estimation activities would be advantageous.
You will have worked with clients who may not have experienced or appreciate Agile delivery methods, and you will be able to evangelise and champion lean delivery and the benefits that it provides. In addition, you will have worked with more classical delivery methods and have demonstrable ways of overcoming the conflicts with Agile delivery.


Required qualifications to be successful in this role
AWS\Azure cloud accreditation
Security based approach
Automation scripting i.e. Ansible\Bash
Containerisation and orchestration management i.e. Docker and Kubernetes
Linux
High competency in DB management
Build automation i.e. Jenkins, GitCI, Concourse

About Us:

Product Madness burst into life in 2007 as the brainchild of two Stanford Business MBA graduates who possessed an innate love of gaming. Initially, the entrepreneurs developed casual games for Facebook and mobile, before having a ‘light-bulb moment’ in 2009 and refocusing their efforts with laser-guided precision on the exploding social casino genre. They have been bringing world-class social slots to real slots fans ever since! Now part of Aristocrat Leisure, Product Madness have published hit titles Heart of Vegas, Cashman Casino, Lightning Link and FaFaFa on Facebook, iOS and Android platforms and have grown considerably in size over the past year.

Product Madness’ dedication to promoting diversity and inclusion is clearly reflected in all our content and across all our platforms. Diversity is more than a commitment at Product Madness—it is in the core values of what we do. We are fully focused on equality and believe deeply in diversity of age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, maternity, marriage or civil partnership, religion, race and all the other fascinating characteristics that make us different.

What is great about working at Product Madness?:

Like all game studios, we have a fully stocked kitchen, foosball table, games room, lunches/breakfasts, beanbags to sit on and much more… but we know this isn’t what makes us unique. What makes us stand out from the crowd is the autonomy we provide our employees, the opportunity to work on top grossing titles and the professional development opportunities that everyone has access to. We understand that our employees are the key to our success and so ensure we pay above the industry standard and offer a comprehensive benefits package. That doesn’t mean to say it's all work and no play, we have a lot of fun creating games from our swanky office in Liverpool Street, as well as having a great social community that is truly reflective of the diverse teams we have here!

Our Background:
Butcher’s Pet Care is a family owned business, with a proud heritage in farming and the meat industry. We make natural foods for pets, which we sell under 3 core brands, as well as producing private label products for major retailers in the UK. The majority of our turnover is in the UK, however we have a subsidiary in Poland that serves the Central European market, and have just established a subsidiary in Shanghai, to look at opportunities in China.
Our core Dog Brand, “Butcher’s”, is the leading UK brand in wet dog food, and underwent a major re-brand in 2018/2019, bringing our values of natural nutrition to the fore, and repositioning it in the minds of our loyal consumers. At the end of 2018, we launched a new Super Premium Cat Brand, “Blink!”, that delivers a 100% shredded meat product, produced entirely from British meat. This complements our existing “Classic” range for cats that is still sold in a number of UK retailers.
We have made a significant investment into our factory in Crick, Northamptonshire, readying the business for expansion, and the launch/re-launch of the brands as above. We have recruited a new leadership team, and replaced key roles in the business, bringing in new skills from outside the industry to step-change our operations. We are now at a crucial point in our journey, where we have the pieces in place for significant growth, and need to drive the business forward, building an efficient, forward-facing business that becomes the go-to for consumers looking to make healthy choices for their pet.
Team overview:
Business decisions are based on facts, and a strong Finance Function team is at the heart of the business. Our finance function has recently been split into two: Financial Control and FP&A. The relatively new FP&A function is a high performing team who is valued by our business. It concentrates on business partnering and driving an analytical culture, which improves decision making and helps us uncover ways of improving our business model – a relentless focus on making things better.
The team has the responsibility of creating a set of analytical tools that help our business leaders understand how the different areas of our business are performing. They will use these tools to uncover opportunities, and take a hands-on approach, looking at all aspects of our operation – both in the UK and overseas markets and in our factory and office environments. As a manufacturing business, with a large on-site food factory, understanding our products, production cost base, the variables and how to drive efficiency, is key. This isn’t just about writing reports; it is a focus on driving change, challenging our existing thinking, and making a tangible difference to the business.

Data Scientist,£40K-£52K (Glassdoor est.),"Guardian Financial Services was established in 2016 as a challenger in the UK Life Insurance sector.
It relaunched under the existing ‘Guardian’ brand, established in 1821 as it was well recognised and well-respected in an adviser community where brand recognition is key.
Guardian sought to bring new life to a Life Insurance proposition that had not materially changed in many years.
This included a superior claims experience, simplified market definitions that are easier for customers to understand, highly rated and competitively priced life and critical illness products and product enhancements that appeal to the consumer; such as dual life policies that allow greater flexibility to joint policy holders.
Guardian launched with a fully digital, Microsoft Azure cloud-based platform which, unlike those of many insurers, is completely paperless. It does not maintain all its own back office systems but outsources core technology infrastructure to third parties. Guardian launched and experienced rapid growth while some of its technology infrastructure and practices were still nascent. Consequently, there are some aspects of our systems that are in the process of being upgraded including our data management and reporting which currently involves combining complex data sets from disparate data sources
In 2020 we embarked upon a project to build a datastore in Azure to improve overall data management capabilities both now and in the future. This project included a significant exercise to create data ontologies and models and map all our current data sources.
As well as housing the data, the datastore comprises a mapper and a decision manager tool: a rules engine based on a drag and drop interface that allow us to manage and create rules around the data models. The underlying data models are based on a common ontology that describes the data and their contextual relationships across the business, linking sales, actuarial, underwriting, finance, operations, proposition and regulatory parts of the business.
Data can be output via APIs or via csv into e.g. Power BI for consumption by the broader business.

UK Wide
An Overview of the Role
The Insights practice is part of Capgemini’s global Insights & Data group; our goal is to help the organisations we work with become truly ‘insight driven’, to fully exploit their data using the convergence of Cloud and Artificial Intelligence to deliver real business value. We marry the most innovative insights solutions with rock solid, industrialised engineering.
The role
Collaboration/Innovation
If we believed all the stories about AI, then we’d be looking for budding magicians, wizards and sorcerers; but we don’t. So, whilst the reality is still, quite frankly, amazing, that’s achieved through a lot of ‘smarts’, rather than magic fairy dust. We want passionate, energetic people who live and breathe all things AI, whether that be machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and so on, combined with great software engineering skills…no point creating great models if we can’t deploy them! We want you to be thinking “how can I use what I know?”, “what do I need to learn?” in order to help your client achieve their business goals.
We take career progression seriously; many of the Insights & Data UK management and the Smart Analytics practice leads did not join in senior positions, rather they were given the opportunities from within to progress. We really do try to balance the needs of the business with the needs and aspirations of the individual…it is in our interests for our people to be happy and successful.
The work
We don’t really have a typical day or typical project at Capgemini. Our clients expect advise, proof-of-values, industrialised solutions; we work on small and very large engagements and we work across several different sectors, including public, CPG, retail, manufacturing and utilities. If you aren’t on a project, you could instead be involved in a bid, doing some training, working on a point-of-view, building a demo or contributing to our blog series (tips from recent new joiners, who we are happy for you to speak with, is just ‘get stuck in’). In recent months, we’ve done some pretty cool stuff, like used Tensor Flow in a model looking at acoustics of voice recordings, used ESA radar data to classify UK vegetation and massive scale Spark for image processing at an O&G client.
Why You?
We are looking to bring in people at all levels, so whilst the list of skills below is fairly heavy, please do get in touch even if you only have two or three.
Detailed knowledge on a range of AI techniques (e.g. supervised and un-supervised machine learning techniques, deep learning, graph data analytics, statistical analysis, time series, geospatial, NLP, sentiment analysis, pattern detection, etc.)
Experience using Python, R or Spark to extract insights from data
Knowledge of SQL for accessing and processing data (PostgreSQL preferred but general SQL knowledge more important)
Experience using the latest Data Science platforms (e.g. Databricks, Dataiku, AzureML, SageMaker) and frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow, MXNet, scikit-learn)
Software engineering practices (coding practices to DS, unit testing, version control, code review)
Hadoop (especially the Cloudera and Hortonworks distributions), other NoSQL (especially Neo4j and Elastic), and streaming technologies (especially Spark Streaming)
Alchemy, spell casting and potion making
Deep understanding of data manipulation/wrangling techniques
Experience using development and deployment technologies, for instance virtualisation and management (e.g. Vagrant, Virtualbox), continuous integration tools (e.g. Jenkins, Concourse, Drone, Bamboo), configuration management tooling (e.g. Ansible) and containerisation technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm)
Delivering insights using visualisation tools or libraries (Javascript preferred)
Experience building and deploying solutions to Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) including Cloud provisioning tools (e.g. Terraform)
Strong interpersonal skills with the ability to work with clients to establish requirements in non-technical language.
Ability to translate business requirements into plausible technical solutions for articulation to other development staff.
Experience designing Data Science deliveries, planning projects and/or leading team
Why Us?
While we’re a global consultancy, we’re made up of supportive, close-knit communities. Everyone wants to get the best solutions for our customers and create the best working environment.

Upskilling
Potential is just as important to us as having the required skills. If you have the right mindset, we might be able to provide you with bespoke training. So if you’re not sure you have all the skills you need, but you’re still passionate about the role, please apply and we’ll see if we can support you.

Diversity

Capgemini positively encourages applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or belief, marital status, or pregnancy and maternity. We are committed to hiring, developing and retaining the best people to deliver innovative, world-class solutions for our clients. We foster an inclusive culture that enables everyone to achieve their full potential and enjoy a fulfilling career with us. Our comprehensive flexible benefits package and lifestyle policies enable our employees to balance their individual, family and work-life needs.

"Data Scientist, Operations",£35K-£55K (Glassdoor est.),"We're looking for a curious, adaptable Data Scientist to join the Data & Customer Operations teams at Monzo!

You'll have the chance to analyse all aspects of our customer support operations and help the teams scale how we work to support millions of customers.

We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.

The Data & Customer Operations teams


The data team's mission is to

Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.

For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics. You'll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.

The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that's what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.

The role


The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.

A few examples of questions and challenges:
How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?
You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We're looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.

What's special about data at Monzo?


Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You should apply if:


What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!
You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues
You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions
You're comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You are happiest exploring data, making discoveries and understanding their implications
You can manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities
